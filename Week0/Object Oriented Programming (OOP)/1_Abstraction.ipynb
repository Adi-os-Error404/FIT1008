    "\n",
    "> Abstraction is used for __hiding__ the background details or any unnecessary __`implementation`__ of the data so that users only see the required information.\n",
    "\n",
    "> A __class__ that consists of __abstract method/s__ is called an \"__abstract class__\".\n",
    "\n",
    "> An __abstract class__ can act like a blueprint to other classes, which are useful when we are designing __large__ functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "> The __subclass__ which inherits an __abstract class__ can refer to the __abstract methods__ for __`implementing`__ the features.\n",

    "#### Some notable points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated. In simple words, we cannot create objects for the abstract classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An abstract class can contain both types of methods: normal and abstract methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In the abstract methods, we do not provide any definition or code. But in the normal methods, we provide the implementation of the code needed for the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An abstract methods can have some implementation, they simply need to be redefined. \n",
    "It is often preferable to implement the shared functionality in the abstract method and use super( ) to invoke this in the concrete class.\n",
