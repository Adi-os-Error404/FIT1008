# __FIT1008__-S2 2023: fit1008.clayton-x@monash.edu (AU)



## Weekly workload expectations every week:

You should go over and understand the pre-reading lesson: < 2 hours

<br>

After you have completed the lesson, you should attend each of the following in-class sessions:

> Workshop session: __2 hours__

> Applied theory session: __2 hours__

> Applied practical session: __2 hours (optional)__

For all the assessments, you are expected to work __~6 hours a week__ but this is very variable and depends on you. Make sure you start working early and submit your work on time.

## In-class activities

As mentioned above, there are three types of in-class activities:

<br>

### __Workshops:__

Workshops are supposed to be complementary to the pre-reading materials and act as a lecture with a flavour of active learning, where you will be involved in solving a number of code challenges together with your peers and your lecturer. They will also be recorded for those of you who cannot attend; the recordings will be made available on the same day but typically a bit later.

<br>

### __Applied theory classes:__

to be given by a TA in a smaller room. Applied theory sessions should facilitate your understanding of the theory part of the subject. They are ideal for asking all sorts of questions regarding the materials covered.

<br>

### __Applied practical classes:__

to be given by a TA in a smaller room. These serve to cover the practical side of things and facilitate your understanding of how things work in practice. Again, there should be plenty of opportunities to ask questions here.
